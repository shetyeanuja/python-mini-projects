A two way communication between client and server using python

#Hello there

#I have made a two way client server chat using python.

#I have used tkinter for attractive GUI

##How to run the python files

#Step 1 - First, run the client.py file and then the server.py file

#Step 2 - Align the GUI of both the files as shown in align.PNG image

#Step 3 - Press the "Accept request from client" button present on server's GUI

#Step 4 - Now, client has to instantiate the chat. His reply will be seen on server's GUI and server has to reply back whcih would be seen on client's GUI

#Step 5 - A client can end the chat by pressing "End Chat" button

#Plz note --- When one sends the message, he has to wait until he get's a reply from another one, as after sending the message, the GUI becomes unresponsive indicating he's waiting for reply.
