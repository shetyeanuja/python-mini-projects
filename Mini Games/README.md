Holaa.. the repo include games coded in python like number guessing, painting and stone paper scissor.

game1 - A game where you have to guess the number generated by random function. You will have infinite chances to guess it.

game2 - A basic paint board where you can scribble and save it.

game3 - A game played by many of us that's stone, paper, scissor. Can you defeat me in this game?

Which file to run first? - Make sure you run the khel.py file.

What libraries are used? - I coded these games by making use of simple and easy libraries. Here's a small gist of libraries been used.

* Tkinter - For making an attractive GUI.

* Random - For generating random values in game1 and game3

* PIL - For saving the scribble in game2

* Winsound - For adding music
