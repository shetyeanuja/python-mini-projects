Hey, I have made small games like guessing number, painting and stone paper scissor using python. I have added a music to the file. The source code has been included.

game1 - It is a game where you have to guess the number generated by random function. You will have infinite chances to guess it.

game2 - It is just a basic paint board where you can scribble and save it in your pc.

game3 - It is a game played by many of us i.e stone, paper, scissor. Can you defeat me in this game?

Which file to run first? - Make sure you run the khel.py file.

What libraries I used? - Ok so I coded these games by making use of BASIC python. No complex libraries are used. Here's a small gist of the libraries I used.

* Tkinter - For making an attractive GUI.

* Random - For generating random values in game1 and game3

* PIL - For saving the painting in game2

* Winsound - For adding music

Rest other libraries mentioned you can omit as they aren't used.
